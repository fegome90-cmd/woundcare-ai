WoundCare AI – Demo Version

WoundCare AI is a modular, AI-powered platform designed to assist in the management and monitoring of chronic, oncological, and complex wounds.
This repository contains the demo version of the application, intended for prototyping, testing, and community contributions.

⚠ Disclaimer: This demo is not a medical device, has not been clinically tested, and does not provide guaranteed or proven results. It should not be used for actual patient care.

Key Features (Demo Scope)
	•	Modular and scalable architecture: each function (analysis, recommendations, monitoring) is implemented as an independent module that can be activated, deactivated, or customized.
	•	Explainable AI: recommendation engines that display the reasoning behind each suggestion.
	•	Real-time monitoring: dashboard with simulated clinical and cost metrics.
	•	EHR/HIS compatibility (planned): HL7 FHIR integration for hospital system interoperability.
	•	Demo mode: simulated data for testing and training.
	•	Lightweight UI: designed to work even in low-connectivity environments.

How It Works (Demo Flow)
	1.	Data Input
	•	Manually entered by the user.
	•	Optionally simulated from example datasets.
	2.	AI Module Processing
	•	Wound status assessment.
	•	Risk evaluation and prioritization.
	•	Generation of a structured care plan.
	3.	Recommendations & Alerts
	•	Suggested protocols based on wound type and available resources.
	•	Estimated impact indicators (healing time, costs).
	4.	Monitoring & Follow-up
	•	Simulated photographic and clinical progress tracking.
	•	Centralized dashboard view.
	5.	Continuous Optimization
	•	Algorithm adjustments based on simulated evolution data.
	•	Incremental learning from validated demo datasets.
